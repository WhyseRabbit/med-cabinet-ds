      "['100-Og' 'hybrid ' 4.0 'Creative,Energetic,Tingly,Euphoric,Relaxed'\n 'Earthy,Sweet,Citrus'\n '$100 OG is a 50/50 hybrid strain that packs a strong punch. The name supposedly refers to both its strength and high price when it first started showing up in Hollywood. As a plant, $100 OG tends to produce large dark green buds with few stems. Users report a strong body effect of an indica for pain relief with the more alert, cerebral feeling thanks to its sativa side.']\n['American-Dream' 'hybrid ' 4.7\n 'Focused,Euphoric,Tingly,Energetic,Relaxed' 'Earthy,Sweet,Pungent'\n 'American Dream by Sensi Seeds is an indica-dominant strain that blends Afghan Skunk with Jamaican and Hawaiian genetics. Its name is charged with meaning, mainly in that this indica represents “honest toil, personal improvement, and enjoying the fruits of one’s labor,” as Sensi Seeds puts it. Earthy and skunky in flavor, American Dream helps you pursue happiness with balanced uplifting, social effects appropriate for day or evening use.\\xa0']\n['Ak-48' 'hybrid ' 4.0 'Happy,Energetic,Uplifted,Creative,Relaxed'\n 'Earthy,Pungent,Citrus'\n \"Although it is a hybrid, the AK-48 high leans more towards typical sativa effects. \\xa0AK-48's parents are Ice and Jock Horror. \\xa0Its Ice mother has ancestors of Afghani, Skunk, Northern Lights and Shiva stock.\"]\n['Tutti-Frutti' 'hybrid ' 4.2 'Happy,Euphoric,Uplifted,Energetic,Relaxed'\n 'Berry,Sweet,Tropical'\n 'As the name suggests, Tutti Frutti provides a blast of fruit flavor that sativa lovers will flock to. Flash Seeds has taken genetic traits from Blue Haze, Green Haze, Thai, and others, then mixed in a fast-finishing ruderalis to create an automatic flowering strain that provides potent euphoric effects. The effects are known to come on slow, so be patient with these uplifting buds.']\n['Chems-Sister' 'sativa ' 4.5 'Creative,Euphoric,Happy,Focused,Relaxed'\n 'Chemical,Pungent,Citrus'\n 'Chem’s Sister, also known as Chem Sis, is a sativa-dominant variation of the classic Chemdawg strain. This phenotype first emerged in 1996 and has since evolved into the uplifting, long-lasting sativa we see on the market today. Her strong cerebral effects come coupled with a distinct skunky diesel aroma underscored by accents of sweet sandalwood and citrus. Over the course of her maturation, Chem Sis’s mint green buds burst with white hairs that darken with age.']\n"
